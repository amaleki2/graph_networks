# Graph Networks

This is a pytorch implementation of [graph_nets](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets) framework of DeepMind.
For additional information checkout 
 [**Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261).
In particular, we implement the encode-process-decode introduced in [MeshGraphNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03409.pdf).

### Dependencies
- torch
- torch-geometric

### Example
`configs.json` includes an example for how the parameters can be specified.
